## What Are Reflection Tokens?

Reflection tokens are also known as reward tokens, because they pay token holders a portion of collected fees simply for holding them through a static reward system. Their functionality provides investors with a source of passive income.

A portion of the transaction fees assessed on cryptocurrency transactions can be passed on to investors holding reflection tokens. The process is completed through a reflection mechanism that uses smart contracts to distribute the tokens to all investors in the liquidity pool. While this may seem like a complicated process, it’s simpler than either mining, staking or yield farming. Thus, crypto reflection tokens make it easier for investors of all skill levels to generate passive income from their holdings.

## How Do Reflection Tokens Work?

Cryptocurrency markets are well-known for their volatility, which is often the result of traders trying to achieve gains through buying low and selling high. For example, when whales, or major cryptocurrency investors, buy and sell a large number of crypto coins at one time, values can rise or dip dramatically in a short period of time.

Reflection tokens provide investors with another way to earn income, encouraging investors to hold rather than trade their tokens. This promotes market stability and allows investors to profit, even if they don’t have the time available to constantly monitor the market.

The reflection mechanism gives token holders a percentage of the transaction tax imposed when a native token is traded. Distribution is equitable to all liquidity pool providers, based on their share of the pool. Smart contracts ensure that the reflection process is fully transparent and executed instantly.

Reflection tokens also benefit each program responsible for its native coin. This benefit stems from raising and maintaining funds that can be used to further develop the program, which can use a portion of its transaction tax to fund growth and stability.
